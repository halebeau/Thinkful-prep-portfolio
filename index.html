          <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>
              I was born and raised in San Diego. For the last 20 years I've 
              succeeded as a hair stylist, which has given me superior client 
              relationship skills and a trained eye for trends, fashions and allure. 
              My journey into tech started
              in Los Angeles though, when I got a job in Post-Production and became a 
              'Video Restoration Artist'. After tha I went on
              to becoming a 'Stereographic Composition Artist'. So as you can
              guess, I've spent many many hours behind a computer cracking down
              a deadline.

              Though it was the artistic side of computer work, I've
              always been interested in how it old got done behind the scenes. I
              was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my
              own specific needs.
              That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When
              I learned how to build my first webpage, I realized I found
              something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for
              in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development,
              where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write
              clean, elegant code.
